# Password Manager with a Web interface

With a web interface the application is more accessible. I started building the web version of the orginal command line Password Manager, using purely Flask. And rewrote the front end using React afterwards. The application is suppposed to be ran locally though. Eventually, Jest was added to run unit tests.  
The web version serves same functions as the command line app, using only minimial style sheet. But in the process, I can get my hands on various libraries to enchance my skills in Flask, Javascript, React, Axios, Jest/Pytest. And also need to review the project in a design aspect.
