# Start Simple

While learning Python programming, I started building a command line project serves as a basic password manager. Unlock with a master password, enter an url to create a new entry. The program may read url from clipboard too.
With features such as:  
- recognize entry by top-level domain instead of unprocessed url
- passwords are encrypted, and
- saved in SQLite database

A small project, yet involves several skills in cipher, string manupilation, and database.
