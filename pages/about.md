### Coding
I'm working on some web application projects, make use of Python/Flask back end, React front end and MySQL database. I start to write about my projects, the experience of how the application being developed.  
Graduated from university with a degree in science(Physics major), I have been exposed to the power of programming to solve mathematics problems, which is an essential part of the training. Indeed, software engineering is capable to do much, much more.  
Before I decided to develope my career in software engineering, I worked in the manufraturing industry as a sale engineer, proficient in sales and marketing of the printed circuit board(PCB) business.  

### Besides coding
I like hiking and photography. The above photo of a beautiful dragonfly was photographed in Sai Kung, Hong Kong.
